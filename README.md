Studying worldwide goat population can help us understand molecular diversity across and within continents. PCA is a standard method used for ancestry inference, such as adjusting for population structure and identifying ethnic origins. Failing to account for differences in genetic ancestry may lead to biases in various genetic discoveries. We want to produce a few PCA plots (similar to Figure 4 in the literature) to better understand how we can subset out data for association analysis.
